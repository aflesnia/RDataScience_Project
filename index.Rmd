# Introduction
Sea Ice  

I will be focusing on the relationship between rising temperatures and sea ice levels in the Arctic as this is a major indication of climate change currently. I will examine trends in sea ice extents over the course of decades in comparison with warming event data (frequency, duration, etc). I will proceed to create graphics that will demonstrate the relationships between these factors and interpret their meanings. 

# Materials and methods

The following graphics display the Arctic in the years 2003 and 2008, displaying sea ice thickness in each year. The final graphic shows the difference in thickness between the two years compared.

You can do bullets like this:
C:\Users\Local1\Documents\R Project






See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.





Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):
```{r}
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```
```{r}
thickness03 <- raster("C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/laser1_thickness_mskd.tif")
plot(thickness03)
thickness08 <- raster("C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/laser3k_thickness_mskd.tif")
plot(thickness08)
spplot(stack(thickness03, thickness08))
boundary <- readOGR(dsn = "C:/Users/Local1/Documents/R Project/ARPA_polygon",layer = "ARPA_polygon")
boundary <- boundary[boundary$OBJECTID==2,]
projection(thickness03) <- CRS(proj4string(boundary))
projection(thickness08) <- CRS(proj4string(boundary))
thickness03_mask <- mask(thickness03, boundary)
names(thickness03_mask) <- "Sea Ice Thickness in 2003"
thickness08_mask <- mask(thickness08, boundary)
names(thickness08_mask) <- "Sea Ice Thickness in 2008"
spplot(stack(thickness03_mask, thickness08_mask))
diff <- thickness08_mask - thickness03_mask
names(diff) <- "Difference in Ice Thickness"
spplot(diff)
``` 





```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```
